Certainly! Here's a summary of the Operations Management Project described in the document:

### **Objective:**
The project aims to teach students how to use optimization tools (specifically Excel Solver) to solve real-world resource allocation problems. The focus is on practical application, including problem modeling, sensitivity analysis, and solution analysis.

---

### **Key Requirements:**

1. **Project Selection and Problem Definition:**
   - Choose a real-world situation and identify a single problem to solve using Excel Solver.
   - Examples include minimizing shipping costs, optimizing production schedules, or maximizing profits.
   - The report should include:
     - Project title.
     - Description of the selected real-world situation and the problem to be resolved.

2. **Model Setup in Excel:**
   - Create a spreadsheet model with three main sections:
     1. **Data Section:** Supply, demand, cost, or benefit data.
     2. **Decision Variable Section:** Values that Excel Solver can modify to solve the problem.
     3. **Objective Function:** The value being optimized (e.g., cost, profit).
   - Include assumptions, decision variables, objective function, and constraints in the report.

3. **Using Excel Solver:**
   - Activate Excel Solver, specify settings and parameters, and run it to find the optimal solution.
   - Save the problem model in the Excel spreadsheet for future use.
   - The report should include:
     - Screenshots of Excel Solver settings and parameters.
     - Screenshots of the spreadsheet with the optimal solution.

4. **Sensitivity Analysis (What-If Scenarios):**
   - Create at least one What-If scenario to analyze the impact of changes on decision variables and the objective function.
   - The report should include:
     - Description of the What-If scenario(s).
     - Screenshots of Excel Solver settings and parameters.
     - Screenshots of the spreadsheet with the optimal solution.

5. **Result Analysis and Conclusions:**
   - Interpret and analyze the solution provided by Excel Solver.
   - Compare the optimal solution with the What-If scenarios.
   - Use charts or diagrams to present the analysis if necessary.

6. **Documentation and Submission:**
   - Submit a formal report (Word document) and the Excel spreadsheet model.
   - Deadline: Week 19.

### **Evaluation Criteria (Rubrics):**
Marks are awarded based on:
- Problem definition and description.
- Excel model setup and accuracy.
- Use of Excel Solver and saving the model.
- Number and quality of What-If scenarios.
- Analysis and interpretation of results.
- Completeness and thoroughness of the report and Excel model.
